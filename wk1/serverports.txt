Definition of Server Port
A server port is a logical endpoint used by networked devices to communicate with a server application or service. It is identified by a unique number, referred to as the port number, which helps route data to the correct application or process on a server.

What is the Server Port Range?
The range of server ports is divided into three categories:

Well-known Ports (0–1023): Reserved for standard services (e.g., HTTP, FTP, etc.).
Registered Ports (1024–49151): Assigned to specific services by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) but not universally standardized.
Dynamic/Private Ports (49152–65535): Used for temporary or private connections, often for client-side communications.
The total range of server ports is 0 to 65535.

How Many Bits Does the Number Represent?
Port numbers are represented using 16 bits, which allows for a maximum of 
=65,536 possible values (from 0 to 65535).
